# flask-forex
A Little Baby Forex Converter made with Flask &lt;3


This is a tiny little forex Converter I made for school a while ago as a way to demonstrate my testing and basic knowledge of flask. 

Some of the highlights of this project include:
==============================================
- Try/Catch error handling
- Basic testing in unittest test library
- Learning to create focused view functions (each route handles specific functionality)

Note
----
Normally I would not leave pdb in my imports but I wanted to leave it in as a demonstration of my fav debugging strategy- breakpoints <3
